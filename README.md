# Python-API-Challenge

I set the units for the API to be imperial so the temperature could be easier to understand. For example the temperature was now in Fahrenheit instead of Celcius. I also defined lineregress to make it easier for me to plot the regression line in all 8 charts without having to copy over a lot of code each time.
